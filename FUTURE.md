# Future Roadmap (ideas)

- Add templating for easier element composition
- Improved CSS generator with utility classes
- Support for bundling into a single .html file without server (client-only)
- Better dev tooling: auto-reload, CLI, build step
- TypeScript-first binding for typed py->js event payloads
